# VRCCT
VRChat Cache Tool For Windows

A quick and easy way to clear your VRChat cache, and make or remove symbolic links.


Symbolic links make the cache appear in another drive or location, taking up space there instead, but any program will see the folder as being in the same place as before. (good for SSD or small main drive users especially)


Usage Instructions:

  1.) Download file

  2.) Put it somewhere you want to use it from

  3.) Run it

  4.) Tell me if there are any issues (there shouldn't be...but you know)

If you have issues, just upload the `VRCCT-log.txt` with your bug report. Be as descriptive as possible.


Don't delete the VRCCT.ini it creates, but you're free to delete the log (though it'll make a new one on every tool startup, clearing the old anyway)
